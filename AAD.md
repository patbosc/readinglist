#Azure Active Directory

[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/identity-management](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/identity-management)
There is one Whitepaper which shows a Cloud Leading Architecture, However it is a possibility which we didn’t discussed but obviously you can also create the whole infrastructure for the System in the cloud as well. I like the Whitepaper because it has some great resources and references.

Getting Started with Azure Active Directory.
AAD Landing Page[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/)
Nice Comparison between editions and public prices. [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/active-directory/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/active-directory/)

AAD Overview[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-whatis/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-whatis/)
I like the getting started Videos more.[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/active-directory/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/active-directory/)

For those of you how just wanted to take a course and find the right spots to look at:

You can associate Azure Subscriptions to Azure Active Directories. (Didn’t talk about it, but it will come sooner or later)[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory/)
While the Site explain the basic concepts I like to mention that I can help you setup up an existing Subscription to an existing Azure AD, since it is tricky. If you ever run into that issue: (A lot of O365 Users do actually)
However I found this article a few years ago and it is just brilliant and helped me so many times. [http://www.clemensreijnen.nl/post/2014/07/11/Add-an-existing-Office-365-Azure-Active-Directory-to-your-Azure-Subscription](http://www.clemensreijnen.nl/post/2014/07/11/Add-an-existing-Office-365-Azure-Active-Directory-to-your-Azure-Subscription)
(If you want to manage an existing O365 Directory by Azure AD for example.)

And since you mentioned it in your E-Mail here you can find the Self Service Portal.

More about that Topic[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-passwords/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-passwords/)

My repository about O365 Contains also a Large section of the Tools I mentioned as well as the Graph Explorer and Samples.[https://github.com/patbosc/readinglist/blob/master/Office.md](https://github.com/patbosc/readinglist/blob/master/Office.md)

There is a large section just around AAD. As well as the Graph.

Dir Sync (Depricated) and the upgrade to Azure AD Connect:

There was a question around customizing the Sync Entities:
When using legacy Dirsync: [http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/19901.dirsync-list-of-attributes-that-are-synced-by-the-azure-active-directory-sync-tool.aspx](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/19901.dirsync-list-of-attributes-that-are-synced-by-the-azure-active-directory-sync-tool.aspx)

There was a question around how to setup users and change information when the cloud would be the leading system. 
Here is how to do that: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-users-create-azure-portal/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-users-create-azure-portal/)

For the connection with G-Suite I think this Video explains great how it works.[https://azure.microsoft.com/sv-se/documentation/articles/active-directory-saas-google-apps-tutorial/](https://azure.microsoft.com/sv-se/documentation/articles/active-directory-saas-google-apps-tutorial/)

On the Yubikey I have to admit there is not a single Plug and Play solution. However there can be a lot of things achieved with a little invest in terms of time.
