Quantum Computing

Liquid
----
LIQUi|〉 is a simulation platform developed by the Quantum Architectures and Computation team at Microsoft Research to aid in the exploration of quantum computation. LIQUi|〉 stands for “Language Integrated Quantum Operations”. A quantum operation is usually referred to as a unitary operator (U) applied to a column state vector

ReVerC
----
ReVerC (pronounced “reverse”) is a reversible circuit compiler which compiles
a high-level, ml-like language to combinational reversible circuits. It is fully
verified in the sense that the program and compiled circuit, when generated by 
ReVerC, will produce the same output for every input. Furthermore, it is 
formally verified that any ancilla bits used by the compiler are correctly 
cleaned and returned to the pool of 0-initialized ancillas.
