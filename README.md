# Readinglist

I started the readinglist way back ... And it surfed me well. I took the time and updated it form time to time. 

Now in 2021 I decided to finally fix most of the glitter and update it.

I have been working with Microsoft Graph from day one, in different rings and teams calling api from day one. So yes, ... you can imagine ...

[Azure](Azure.md)
